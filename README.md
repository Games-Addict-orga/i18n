# 🎮 Games-Addict

Welcome to the **Games-Addict** GitHub organization!  
This project is focused on developing a complete **Discord bot for gamers**, featuring game statistics, player tools, and community-focused utilities.

> 🔒 The main bot source code is private.  
> 🌍 However, the **translation system is fully open for contributions**!

## 📂 Repository Structure

We currently maintain the following public repositories:

| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [translations](https://github.com/Games-Addict-orga/i18n) | 🌐 Language files and community-driven translation system |

---

## 🌐 Help Us Translate the Bot

You can contribute by translating the bot into your native language!  
Translations are organized in the `i18n` directory by language and game/module.

Example structure:
```
i18n/
├── en-US/
│   ├── common.json
│   ├── apex.json
│   ├── ...
├── fr-FR/
│   ├── common.json
│   ├── ...
```

✅ **The folders `fr-FR` and `en-US` are complete and can be used as references when creating or updating other languages.**

### 🧩 How to contribute:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. Add or update a folder for your language (e.g., `de-DE`, `es-ES`)
3. Translate the values in each file (do not change the keys)
4. Submit a **Pull Request**

➡️ Make sure to keep placeholders like `{playerName}` intact.  
Inline comments in the template files will help you understand the context.

## 📘 Guidelines

- Use neutral and respectful language
- Keep dynamic variables unchanged (`{example}`)
- Maintain the tone and meaning of the original messages
